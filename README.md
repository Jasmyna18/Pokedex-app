This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.

This is an Angular-based Pokemon application that allows users to:

1. View a paginated list of Pokemon and search for them by their names.

2. Catch Pokemon and store them locally.

3. View the list of captured Pokemon and remove them from the list.

4. Play a Pokemon-catching mini-game.
